Algorithm:

1. The algorithm is based on column generation technique.

2. Column generation focuses on iteratively adding columns (variables) 
   to the master problem to find an optimal solution. 

3. In the context of the bus scheduling problem we have:

   Master Problem: The master problem represents 
   a linear programming relaxation of the original problem. 
   It contains a subset of variables (columns) from the full problem, 
   and its solution provides a lower bound on the optimal objective value.

   Pricing Problem: The pricing problem is a subproblem within the column 
   generation algorithm. It is responsible for finding new columns (variables) 
   that have negative reduced costs, i.e., they can further improve the objective value. 
   The pricing problem is a combinatorial problem or a simplified version of the main problem. 
   In our code, we have a pricing problem for each shift.

4. DAG Connection: While our code doesn't explicitly create a directed acyclic graph, 
   the concept is related in the following way:
   In column generation,  the process of adding columns can be viewed as a 
   directed graph where nodes represent different columns (bus plans) and directed edges 
   represent the decision to add a new column based on the pricing problem's solution.

5. The graph evolves as we add columns during the iterations, ensuring that we 
   do not visit the same column more than once. This property results in a 
   directed acyclic graph because revisiting a column would imply a cycle, 
   which is undesirable in the column generation process.

6. Termination: The column generation process typically terminates when no more 
   negative reduced cost columns can be found in the pricing problem. 
   This corresponds to reaching a situation where no more edges can be added to the graph, 
   and the optimal solution is achieved.
